IIP is Infinitecoin Core Improvement Protocol

People wishing to submit IIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the ifc@1e9.cc mailing list. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving IIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a IIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Infinitecoin users.

IIP 是无限币核心改进协议

想要提交IIP的人，首先应该向ifc@1e9.cc邮件列表提出他们的想法或文件。经讨论后，请打开一份请购单，复印件编辑验收后，将在此处发布。

我们在批准IIP方面相当自由，并尽量不代表社区参与决策。当一个决定是有争议的并且不能达成一致意见时，这种例外情况很少出现在争议解决的案例中。在这些情况下，保守的选择总是首选。

在这里拥有一个IIP，直到它的状态成为最终的或有效的，它才成为正式接受的标准。

那些提出改变的人应该考虑到最终的同意可能取决于无穷大用户的共识。
